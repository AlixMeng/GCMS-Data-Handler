# GCMS Data Handler #

This tool provides file sorting and backup functionality for **gas chromatography** systems. 

## Features ##

- moving files from a default location into a specified location
- sorting of files into subfolders based on filename
- backup of zipped files into a specified backup folder
- the script provides a log file with all conducted operations

## How does it work? ##



## How do I get set up? ##
The tool is written in pure Python (3.5). There are no third party modules needed. You just need a working install of Python 3.X.

Copy the GCMSDH.py into the default location of the files to be sorted. For Agilent Systems this might be ``D:\MSD_data\``.
